# DeltaX Galaxy Engine

This repository contains the full codebase for reproducing the results presented in the paper:

**"A Universal Geometric Equation for Galaxy Rotation Curves Derived from Modified Einstein Dynamics"**  
by Christopher P. B. Smolen

## Overview

The `deltax_galaxy_engine` implements the Î”X relation â€” a geometric mapping between luminous structure and galaxy rotation dynamics â€” derived from a modified Einstein field equation incorporating information-geometry structure.

This engine evaluates the Î”X equation across the SPARC sample (175 late-type galaxies) and includes extension logic for early-type galaxies via entropy-based inversion.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AXVIAM/deltax_galaxy_engine.git
gh repo clone AXVIAM/deltax_galaxy_engine
cd deltax_galaxy_engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python 3.8+ is recommended.

---

### ðŸ›  Usage

You can run the engine over a SPARC-format input directory using:

```bash
python -m deltax_galaxy_engine.cli /path/to/Rotmod_LTG --verbose
```

The CLI will:
- Load each galaxyâ€™s photometric and rotation data
- Apply the Î”X equation
- Output RMSE metrics, affine anchoring coefficients, and summary tables
